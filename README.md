# Generative Art

work in progress

## Usage

```sh
# clone repo and navigate to root
git clone https://github.com/PhilippReinke/generative-art.git
cd generative-art

# run examples
go run ./examples/simple-canvas
go run ./examples/colored-rects
```

The results will be stored in `out/`.

## Ideas

* produce gif representing different stages of process
* read more about generative art and implement examples

Implement some gif stuff

* eye zoom
* explosions
